# Bank_Management_System

Bank system is a system that describes the bank. Firstly, Bank has name and code
and it compose of branches and in bank there are several bank accounts. Also, in
bank I can add new branch or remove branch of the bank. Also, in bank I can add
bank account or erase bank account. In branch I can add ATM or remove ATM.
Bank Account have account number, account balance, customer name and a list
of transactions. Also, in Bank Account we need to deposit money or withdraw
money.
I need all transactions that happened in bank to be saved and also the
transactions of dedicated customer.
A transaction record transaction number , account number , transaction amount
, balance after the transaction and transaction type.
ATM should show account balance for now but soon will make it to deposit,
withdraw.
